## Who Gerrish Jewelers Is

Gerrish Jewelers is a family-owned jewelry store in Casa Grande, Arizona, offering fine jewelry sales, custom pieces, and repair services. While their in-store service has a long-standing reputation, they wanted to modernize how customers could book repairs and get in touch.

## Challenges

Before the new site, customers could only start a repair by visiting the store or calling during business hours. This often led to phone tag, delays, and extra trips.

Key needs:

- **Online Repair Form:** Let customers start the process anytime.
- **Clear Service Info:** Explain repair options and timelines.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Make the process easy from a phone.
- **Brand Update:** Modern look while keeping their trusted, local feel.

## Building the Solution

We built a clean Astro site with a dedicated repair page and an online booking form that:

- Lets customers submit details and photos of their jewelry
- Sends instant confirmation to the customer and store
- Saves all submissions in a secure database for easy tracking
- Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop

## Matching the Brand

We kept the design elegant and timeless, using gold and deep neutral tones to reflect the jewelry store’s style. High-quality product imagery and a refined layout create a sense of trust and craftsmanship.

## The Result

Gerrish Jewelers can now start repairs faster, reduce unnecessary trips to the store, and keep customers informed from the moment they submit a request. The updated site also strengthens their local brand presence and makes them more accessible to busy customers.
