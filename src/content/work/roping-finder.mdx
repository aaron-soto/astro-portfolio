## What Roping Finder Is

Roping Finder is a dedicated platform for team ropers to find partners, browse upcoming roping events, and manage their own listings. Built for the roping community, it solves a long-standing problem, how to quickly connect with the right partners and keep track of event opportunities in one place.

## Challenges

Before Roping Finder, ropers relied on word-of-mouth, Facebook posts, or outdated event calendars to connect and plan. That meant missed opportunities and last-minute scrambling.

Key needs:

- **Partner Finder:** Ability for ropers to list themselves and find matches by skill level, location, and preferences.
- **Event Listings:** State-filtered event calendar with list and calendar views.
- **Subscription System:** Paid membership for advanced features.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Smooth experience for ropers on the go.

## Building the Platform

We developed Roping Finder as a full-featured Next.js app with Supabase handling data and auth, Stripe for subscriptions, and Cloudinary for profile images. Key features include:

- Searchable partner directory with filters
- Event system showing today’s events first and featuring highlighted competitions
- Admin dashboard for easy event and listing management
- Secure payment and membership handling through Stripe

## Connecting the Community

The UI is designed for speed and clarity, with a clean layout and bold event visuals so ropers can find what they need in seconds. The partner profiles and event pages use clear calls-to-action, making it easy to connect or register without extra steps.

## The Result

Roping Finder brings the team roping community into one central hub, reducing missed opportunities and helping ropers plan their seasons more effectively. With subscriptions generating ongoing revenue and a growing user base, it’s become a reliable tool for both casual ropers and serious competitors.
