## Who Purpose After Sports Is

Purpose After Sports is a community-focused organization dedicated to helping former athletes transition into new careers and maintain strong connections after their playing days. They provide resources, host events, and sell branded merchandise to support their mission.

They needed a central platform where athletes could easily find resources, order gear, and stay connected through regular content updates all managed without technical headaches.

## Challenges

Before the project, Purpose After Sports was running operations across multiple disconnected tools, one for resources, one for e-commerce, and another for updates. This created extra work and made it harder for visitors to find what they needed.

Key needs:

- **Unified Hub:** A single platform combining content, resources, and store.
- **E-Commerce Integration:** Easy online ordering for branded merchandise.
- **Editable Content:** Ability to add new resources and news without developer help.
- **Strong Branding:** A look and feel that speaks to the athletic community.

## Building the Platform

We built a custom Next.js site connected to Supabase for content and product management. This allowed the Purpose After Sports team to:

- Add and update resources in minutes
- Manage product listings and orders in one place
- Publish news and updates that appear instantly on the site

## Strengthening the Brand

We used a bold color palette and clean typography that reflect the organization’s energy and athletic roots. High-impact imagery and a simple layout make the site easy to navigate while keeping the focus on the community and mission.

## The Result

Purpose After Sports now has a streamlined, branded platform that brings all their operations under one roof. Visitors can browse resources, shop for merchandise, and keep up with updates while the team manages everything from a single dashboard. The new site saves hours each week and creates a consistent experience for the community.
