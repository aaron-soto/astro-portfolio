## Who William Douglas Co. Is

William Douglas is a skilled craftsman specializing in custom furniture and unique wood art. Based in Phoenix, Arizona, his work blends traditional woodworking techniques with modern design. He needed a website that could display his portfolio beautifully while making it simple to add new pieces as they were created.

## Challenges

Before the site, William relied on in-person sales and social media posts to show his work. This made it harder for customers to see the full scope of his craftsmanship, and new pieces could easily get lost in a social feed.

Key needs:

- **Showcase Portfolio:** High-quality galleries for furniture and art pieces.
- **Easy Updates:** Add new work without touching code.
- **Product Spotlight:** Highlight pieces that are available for purchase.
- **Brand Consistency:** A design that reflects his craftsmanship and style.

## Building the Portfolio

We built a lightweight Astro site for fast loading and easy management. William can now:

- Upload new projects with descriptions and multiple images
- Organize work into categories (furniture, art, custom builds)
- Feature select pieces on the homepage to draw interest
- Maintain a site that looks polished on both desktop and mobile

## Matching the Craft

The design uses warm tones and clean typography to complement the natural beauty of the wood pieces. A minimalist layout keeps the focus on the images while still giving visitors clear navigation to explore his work.

## The Result

William Douglas Co. now has an online presence that works as a 24/7 showroom. Potential clients can browse his portfolio from anywhere, view detailed images of each piece, and reach out for custom orders, all without relying solely on in-person visits or social media algorithms.
