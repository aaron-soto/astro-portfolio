## Why We Started

We wanted fresh ingredients we could actually cook with. Having food growing right outside makes it easier for us to eat healthier, and it pushed us to try things we normally wouldn't buy at the store.

## The First Build: Two Garden Beds

We started simple with two 4'x6' raised beds. No greenhouse, no fancy setup — just soil, drip irrigation, and the Arizona sun.
Those beds took off. Within a short time we were pulling peppers, onions, herbs, and greens straight from the backyard.

## Expanding the Space

Once we saw how well things were growing, we added two more beds. These were closer to 3'x6' and gave us more room to experiment and plan for the future greenhouse layout.

At this point it was basically a cluster of productive raised beds, so we started thinking about how to protect everything from the heat.

## Adding Shade and Planning the Greenhouse

Arizona summer will cook plants fast, so the next step was building a top frame over the beds and installing garden shade cloth.
That change alone kept things alive through the hottest days.

From there, the idea of a full greenhouse started to form. After expanding the beds, we finally had a clear footprint, so we started sketching framed wall panels wrapped in greenhouse plastic to enclose the space.

## Frame Materials

We used standard framing lumber early on just to get structure in place.
Now that we know the final size and shape, we’re switching to more outdoor-friendly wood that handles sun, moisture, and irrigation better.

## Ventilation + Watering Setup

Greenhouse heat gets intense in Arizona, so we’re installing a small fan in one of the side panels for better airflow.
Watering is automated with a Bluetooth timer running drip lines. It waters everything morning and night with the right amount of water, no guessing.

## What We’re Growing (and Actually Eating)

Here’s what we’ve grown and cooked with so far:

- Jalapeños
- Bell peppers
- Onions
- Garlic
- Chives
- Cucumbers
- Carrots
- Potatoes

Everything tastes better when it comes from your own garden. It makes cooking easier and it keeps us eating healthier because the fresh stuff is always available.

## What’s Next

Once the plastic panels are installed and the fan is running, the whole space will function as a real greenhouse. After that, we’ll start testing what grows best year-round and what needs to be rotated seasonally.
