## What Copper Country Music Fest Is

Copper Country Music Fest is a yearly country music event featuring live performances, food vendors, and local sponsors. Put on by Pinal 40 an organization that supports the local agricultural field and the kids interested in the industry.

## Challenges

This was a new concept that they wanted to launch and I worked with a local marketing company to bring this website to life. We did not really have much to go on, so we had to build the site from the ground up.

Key needs:

- **Online Ticketing:** We would use a Dice embed for online tickets.
- **Artist Promotion:** Easy way to highlight performers and link to their music.
- **Sponsor Exposure:** Dedicated space to feature sponsor logos and links and people to sign up.

## Building the Solution

We developed a fast-loading Astro site with:

- Custom map graphic so visitors can plan their day at the festival
- Spotify embed for the event so attendees can preview the music
- Sponsor section with prominent, clickable logos to maximize partner visibility

## Creating the Festival Vibe

The design uses bold, high-energy colors and textured backgrounds to match the festival’s atmosphere. Large artist images and event photography bring the site to life and get visitors excited to attend.

## The Result

Copper Country Music Fest now has a centralized online hub that drives ticket sales, promotes artists, and gives sponsors more visibility. Attendees can find all the information they need in one place, making it easier than ever to plan their festival experience.
