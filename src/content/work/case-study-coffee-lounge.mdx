## Who Case Study Coffee Lounge Is

Case Study Coffee Lounge is a local coffee shop in Phoenix, Arizona, owned by craftsman and entrepreneur William Douglas. Known for his woodworking and unique coffee shop atmosphere, William wanted a website that could showcase the space, highlight upcoming events, and keep customers in the loop without needing constant manual updates.

The venue also doubles as an event space, so an easy way to promote live events, classes, and community gatherings was a top priority.

## Challenges

Before we worked together, the coffee shop had no central online hub for customers to check hours or see what was happening next. Event details were scattered across social media, which meant customers often missed them.

Key needs:

- **Dynamic Event System:** A way to add and manage upcoming events, including recurring schedules.
- **Clear Store Hours:** Prominently displayed and easy to find.
- **Contact Info:** Fast access for inquiries and bookings.
- **Brand Match:** A design that felt as warm and inviting as the shop itself.

## Building a Dynamic Event System

We developed a recurring event system so the team could set an event once and have it automatically appear weekly, monthly, or on any custom schedule.

This removed the need for repetitive updates and ensured customers always saw current and accurate event info.

## Displaying Store Hours

Store hours are featured right on the homepage and optimized for mobile viewing. Customers no longer need to call or search social media, the info is always up to date and accessible in seconds.

## Matching The Atmosphere Of The Shop

We drew from the coffee shop’s warm orange accents and handcrafted wood details to create a welcoming, brand-consistent site. High-quality imagery and a clean, modern layout make the site easy to navigate while keeping the focus on the shop’s character.

## The Result

Case Study Coffee Lounge now has a site that reflects its brand, keeps customers engaged, and saves time on event management. Customers can quickly check hours, see what’s happening, and connect with the shop, leading to higher event attendance and better customer communication.
