My girlfriend surprised me with a trip to Mexico for my 30th birthday. What she didn't know was that I had my own surprise ready for her. Since she planned most of the trip, I asked if I could take over the first night's dinner. Behind the scenes, I had already worked with the hotel to set up a private dinner right on the beach, table in the sand, margaritas waiting, the whole setup. That's where I asked her to marry me.

The rest of the trip was exactly what you'd hope for after getting engaged. We partied, shared the news with strangers who instantly became our drinking buddies, and just enjoyed the vacation with zero stress. It was perfect.
